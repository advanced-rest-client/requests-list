# Requests list

The ARC requests list module contains an UI and logic to render requests list in various contexts (saved list. history list, project list).

This module replaces:

- history-list-mixin
- requests-list-mixin
- projects-list-consumer-mixin
- history-list-mixin
- saved-list-mixin
- history-panel
- saved-requests-panel

Work in progress.
